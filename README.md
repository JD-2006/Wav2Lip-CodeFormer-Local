# Wav2Lip-CodeFormer
This is a high-definition video digital human project.
First, I use Wav2Lip to modify the mouth shape, and then use CodeFormer for high-definition processing.
This project has a better effect than Wav2Lip-GFPGAN, because CodeFormer performs better in facial restorationã€‚

***

1. git clone this repository.
2. python 1-Setup.py

It will ask if you want to use an existing conda env or not.
